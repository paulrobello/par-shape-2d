# Game Logic Flows and Architecture

## Documentation Guidelines

**Note**: This document is a companion to the `game_event_flows.md` document, which details the event-driven architecture of the game. This document focuses on the overall game logic flows and architecture.

**Updates**: Changes should be integrated directly into existing sections rather than added to a separate "updates" section. Only add new sections when entirely new systems are introduced.

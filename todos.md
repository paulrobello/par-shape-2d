# Things that need to be done

**Important** You must follow the TODO rules below.

## TODO Rules

- Just because lint and build pass does not mean an item is complete. 
- Items should only be marked complete when the user has stated they are complete.
- Only address one item at a time.
- When the user says the item is complete, you can mark it as complete and commit the changes.
- Items are in order of priority and should be addressed in the order they are presented.

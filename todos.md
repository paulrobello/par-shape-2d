# Things that need to be done

**Important** You must follow the TODO rules below.

## Rules
- Just because lint and build pass does not mean an item is complete. 
- Items should only be marked complete when the user has stated they are complete.
- Only address one item at a time.
- When the user says the item is complete, you can mark it as complete and commit the changes.
- Items are in order of priority and should be addressed in the order they are presented.

## Items

- Item 1: Reduce vertical space between the top of the holding holes and the bottoms of the container boxes.
- Item 2: Add a small border between the HUD and the start of the shapes area.
- Item 3: Change the color of the HUD background to a dark gray (#222222).

# Things that need to be done

**Important** Keep documentation up to date then commit as each item is completed. Items are NOT considered complete until verified by the user. Only address one item at a time. 

Items are in order of priority and should be addressed in the order they are in.

## Items

### Item 1 - GameManager.ts is too large

Refactor `GameManager.ts` to reduce its size, by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable modules. This will improve maintainability and readability.

# Things that need to be done

**Important** Keep documentation up to date then commit as each item is completed. Items are considered complete until verified by the user. 

Items are in order of priority and should be addressed in the order they are in.

## Items

[ ] Fix screws thinking they are blocked when they are not ( Enable or add debug to help track this down ).
[ ] Progress should be tracked by number of screws moved to container boxes instead of by number of shapes removed. Now that all layers are generated at start of game, the total screws is known.
[ ] The level is considered won when last container box is removed with final screw.
[ ] Is LevelPrecomputer still needed? If it's not remove it.
[ ] Make ShapeRenderer shape type check more general ( line 143 ).

## Items

### ✅ Item 1 - Screw blocking results are erratic

**Issue**: When clicking a screw it is not properly checking if its blocked. It should only check layers that are visibly in front of it for shapes overlapping it. Currently the user can click screws behind other shaps and some screws that should be clickable are showing as blocked.

Use the following to reconcile the findings from readme and architecture documentation.

Use the following shorthand to refer to the findings and actions to take:

# Shorthand:
- F1 = Finding 1, F2 = Finding 2 etc
- N = NoOp
- A2R = Update the readme to reflect the architecture documentation logic
- R2A = Update the architecture documentation to reflect the readme logic
- R2AC = Update the architecture documentation to reflect the readme logic and update the code accordingly
- C2RA = Update readme and architecture documentation to reflect the code logic

# Examples:
- F1: N = for finding 1, no action needed.
- F2: A2R = for finding 2, update the readme to reflect the architecture documentation logic.
- F3: R2A = for finding 3, update the architecture documentation to reflect the readme logic.
- F4: R2AC = for finding 4, update the architecture documentation to reflect the readme logic and update the code accordingly.
- F5: C2RA = for finding 5, update both the readme and architecture documentation to reflect the code logic.

# Actions:
- F1: R2AC
- F2: A2R
- F3: R2A
- F4: R2A
- F5: R2AC
- F6: R2A
- F7: C2RA

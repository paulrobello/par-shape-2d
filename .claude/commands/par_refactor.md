# Things that need to be done

**Important** You must follow the TODO rules below.

## TODO Rules

- Just because lint and build pass does not mean an item is complete.
- Items should only be marked complete when the user has stated they are complete.
- Only address one item at a time.
- When the user says the item is complete, you can mark it as complete and commit the changes.
- Items are in order of priority and should be addressed in the order they are presented.

## Items

- Read `README.md` to understand the project requirements and specifications.
- Read `game_event_flow.md` to understand the game event flow.
- Read `game_architecture.md` to understand the game architecture.
- Create a refactor.md file to document any significant refactoring changes made to the codebase.
- Audit the codebase for any missing features or incomplete implementations based on the project requirements and specifications.
- Look for redundant or duplicate code that can be refactored, removed or moved to the shared library.
- Update or add comments and documentation to improve code clarity and maintainability.
- Update the documentation in the `docs` folder to ensure it is accurate and up-to-date.
